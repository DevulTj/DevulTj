### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/) with the awesome guys at [Facepunch](https://facepunch.com/).
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm a Gameplay Programmer at heart, but have dabbled with pretty much every aspect of game development.
- ðŸŒ± Sometimes I'll release stuff on my personal GitHub that I feel falls outside of the scope of Facepunch, but please take a look at all of our [public repositories](https://github.com/Facepunch) over there!

  
- ðŸ’¬ Find me over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devultj) where I'll post stupid takes and end up pissing you off.
